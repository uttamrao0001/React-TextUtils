It's designed to make it easier to create interactive and dynamic web applications. React follows the component-based architecture, allowing developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components.\n    \n    Key Concepts and Features:\n    \n    Components: React applications are built using components, which are encapsulated units of UI that can be composed together to create a complete user interface. Components can have their own state and behavior.\n    \n    Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM, known as the Virtual DOM. When changes are made to the UI, React calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM by comparing the Virtual DOM with the previous state.\n    \n    JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. It's used in React to define the structure and content of components.\n    \n    State and Props: Components can have internal state, which represents data that can change over time. Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components.\n    \n    Reactivity: When the state of a React component changes, it triggers a re-render of the component, updating the UI to reflect the new state.\n    \n    Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows in a single direction, from parent to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes propagate through the application.\n    \n    Lifecycle Methods: React components have lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into various stages of a component's lifecycle, such as when it's created, updated, or destroyed.\n    \n    Hooks: React introduced hooks as a way to use state and other React features in functional components, allowing developers to write more reusable and cleaner code.\n    \n    Reusable Components: React's component-based approach promotes code reusability, making it easier to manage and maintain large applications.\n    \n    Ecosystem and Tools:\n    \n    React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and extensions that enhance its capabilities:\n    \n    React Router: A popular library for adding routing and navigation to React applications.\n    Redux: A state management library commonly used with React to manage global application state.\n    Material-UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap: UI component libraries that provide pre-designed components for building consistent and responsive UIs.\n    Webpack, Babel: Tools that help bundle and transpile React code for production.\n    Create React App: A tool that sets up a React project with a preconfigured build process, making it easier to start building without configuring everything from scratch.\n    React has gained widespread adoption in the web development community due to its efficiency, modularity, and developer-friendly features. It's used by countless companies and developers to build everything from single-page applications to complex web applications.`;\n  const [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\n  const AboutReact = () => {\n    //console.log(\"Uppercase button was clicked\");\n    let newText = aboutReact;\n    setText(newText);\n  };\n  const HandleUpClick = () => {\n    //console.log(\"Uppercase button was clicked\");\n    let newText = text.toUpperCase();\n    setText(newText);\n  };\n  const HandleLoClick = () => {\n    //console.log(\"Uppercase button was clicked\");\n    let newText = text.toLowerCase();\n    setText(newText);\n  };\n  const HandleOnChange = event => {\n    //console.log(\"On change\");\n    setText(event.target.value);\n  };\n  return /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(_Fragment, {\n    children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n      className: \"container\",\n      children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        className: \"mb-3\",\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h1\", {\n          children: props.header\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 64,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"textarea\", {\n          className: \"form-control\",\n          value: text,\n          onChange: HandleOnChange,\n          id: \"myText\",\n          rows: \"8\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 65,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 63,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n        className: \"btn btn-primary\",\n        onClick: HandleUpClick,\n        children: [\"Convert to Uppercase  \", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n          className: \"btn btn-primary ms-2\",\n          onClick: AboutReact,\n          children: \"About React\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 67,\n          columnNumber: 99\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 67,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n        className: \"btn btn-primary ms-2\",\n        onClick: HandleLoClick,\n        children: \"Convert to Lowercase\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 68,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 62,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n      className: \"container my-3\",\n      children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n        children: \"Your text summary\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 71,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        children: text.length == 0 ? \"0 words and 0 characters\" : `${text.split(\" \").length} words and ${text.length} characters`\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 72,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n        children: \"Preview\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 78,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        children: text\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 79,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 70,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true);\n}\n_s(TextForm, \"3t0DFnMi16eB/7p7iIKtjG5r68g=\");\n_c = TextForm;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"TextForm\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","useState","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","Fragment","_Fragment","TextForm","props","_s","aboutReact","text","setText","AboutReact","newText","HandleUpClick","toUpperCase","HandleLoClick","toLowerCase","HandleOnChange","event","target","value","children","className","header","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","onChange","id","rows","onClick","length","split","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["C:/Users/uttta/OneDrive/Desktop/ReactJS/textutils/src/components/TextForm.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React, { useState } from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default function TextForm(props) {\r\n    let aboutReact = `React: A JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces\r\n\r\n    React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs).
